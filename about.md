### [Running ride simulations at scale](http://www.slideshare.net/bajajsaurabh/dataengconf-simulations-at-scale)
At Lyft, I built a system for running very large scale ride simulations. This allows data scientist to optimize models for ride pricing, driver dispatch and Lyft line matching. You can read about the technical overview in this slide.
